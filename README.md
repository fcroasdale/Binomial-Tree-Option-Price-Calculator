Binomial Option Pricing Model Visualization
Overview
This Python script provides a comprehensive tool for visualizing and calculating the pricing of European-style options using the Binomial Option Pricing Model. 
The script leverages the mathematical framework of binomial trees to model the potential future prices of an underlying asset at different points in time,
leading up to the option's expiration date. It is equipped with graphical capabilities to visually represent the binomial tree using Pygame, offering insights 
into the dynamics of option pricing.

Parameters such as stock price, exercise price, volatility, time to maturity, and others can be easily adjusted at the beginning of the script. 
Users have the option to run the script in one of two modes:

Graphical Visualization Mode: Displays the complete binomial tree with stock and option prices at each node.
Option Price Output Mode: Provides a straightforward calculation of the option price without graphical output, suitable for quick analyses or command-line usage.

Libraries: Pygame (for graphical representation), Math (for calculations)
Input Parameters: STOCK_PRICE, EX_PRICE, RISK_FREE_PCT, TIME_STEPS, TIME_TO_MATURITY, VOLATILITY
Output: Graphical visualization of the binomial tree or option price at the root node.
System Requirements
Python 3.x
Pygame library
This script is an excellent resource for students, educators, and finance professionals seeking to understand or demonstrate the principles of option pricing 
in a visually engaging and interactive manner.
